# Redo Checkpoint

Lets you <cl>redo</c> (aka remake or recreate) previously <cr>deleted</c> <cg>checkpoints</c>.

Compatible with Transparent Checkpoints and <cr>R</c><co>a</c><cg>i</c><cy>n</c><cj>b</c><ca>o</c><cp>w</c> Checkpoints (and probably any other checkpoint-related mod).

## Usage

When any checkpoint got deleted and there isn't any new one placed, you can use redo key (by default `Shift+Z`) to redo a checkpoint you have previously deleted.

**DISCLAIMER**: After redoing a checkpoint which will appear on the screen, this checkpoint will most likely not appear on Android until it goes out of the screen (it could also occur on Windows aswell).

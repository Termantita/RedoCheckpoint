# Redo Checkpoint

Lets you **redo** (aka remake or recreate) previously deleted checkpoints.

Compatible with **Transparent Checkpoints** and **Rainbow Checkpoints** (and probably any other checkpoint-related mod).

## Usage

When any checkpoint got deleted and there isn't any new one placed, you can use redo key (by default `Shift+Z`) to redo a checkpoint you have previously deleted.

**DISCLAIMER**: After redoing a checkpoint which will appear on the screen, this checkpoint will most likely not appear on Android until it goes out of the screen (it could also occur on Windows aswell).
